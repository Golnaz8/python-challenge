UofT-python-challenge


## Overview 
- In this project we are going to use the concepts we've learned to complete two Python challenges, PyBank and PyPoll.

- In PyBank we are going to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

    - The total number of months included in the dataset

    - The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

    - The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

    - The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

    - The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

- In PyPoll we are going to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

    - The total number of votes cast

    - A complete list of candidates who received votes

    - The percentage of votes each candidate won

    - The total number of votes each candidate won

    - The winner of the election based on popular vote


## Technologies Used
This project leverages several technologies to process and analyze election data efficiently:

- **Python**: The core language used for scripting the analysis, providing robust support for data manipulation and file handling.
- **CSV Module**: Integrated for its straightforward handling of CSV file formats, enabling the reading and processing of election data.
- **OS Module**: Employed to ensure path compatibility across different operating systems, enhancing the script's portability.
- **Visual Studio Code**: Chosen as the preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for coding, debugging, and managing the project files.
- **GitHub**: Hosts the repository online, allowing for backup, sharing, and documentation hosting, including this README file.
